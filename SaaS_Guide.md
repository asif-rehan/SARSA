# SaaS Application Implementation Guide

## Overview
This guide provides a structured approach to building a SaaS application using Test-Driven Development (TDD) with Next.js, Better-Auth, PostgreSQL, and Kysely.

To enable AI-assisted coding with Better-Auth, include these commands:
- `npx @better-auth/cli mcp --open-code`
- `npx skills add better-auth/skills`

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 16.1.1 (App Router)
- **Authentication**: Better-Auth (latest from demo)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Query Builder**: Kysely ^0.28.5
- **Testing**: Vitest, Playwright, Testing Library
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript

---

## 1. Project Setup Guide

### 1.1 Initialize the Project

Run the automated setup script which handles all project initialization:

```bash
# Make script executable and run
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

The script automatically:
- Creates Next.js project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, App Router, ESLint
- Installs all required dependencies (better-auth, kysely, pg, testing libraries)
- Creates `docker-compose.yml` for PostgreSQL
- Creates `scripts/setup-env.sh` for environment configuration
- Creates auth configuration files (`lib/auth.ts`, `lib/db.ts`, `lib/auth-client.ts`)
- Sets up testing configuration (Vitest, Playwright)
- Creates test directories (`__tests__/unit`, `__tests__/integration`, `e2e`)
- Updates `package.json` with necessary scripts

### 1.2 Database Setup

#### Start PostgreSQL

```bash
npm run db:start
```

#### Setup Environment Variables

```bash
./scripts/setup-env.sh
```

This creates `.env.local` with:
- Database URL for PostgreSQL
- Better-Auth secret
- Google OAuth placeholders (update these manually)

#### Run Database Migration

```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

This creates the Better-Auth schema in PostgreSQL.

**Note**: The files below are automatically created by the setup script, but are included here for reference.

#### Reference: docker-compose.yml

```yaml

import { Pool } from "pg";

const dialect = new PostgresDialect({
  pool: new Pool({
    connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  }),
});

export const db = new Kysely({
  dialect,
});
```

#### Reference: lib/auth.ts

```typescript
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { db } from "./db";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  database: db,
  emailAndPassword: {
    enabled: true,
  },
  socialProviders: {
    google: {
      clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID!,
      clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET!,
    },
  },
});
```

#### Reference: lib/auth-client.ts

```typescript
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client";

export const authClient = createAuthClient({

});
```

### 1.3 Testing Configuration

The following files are automatically created by the setup script. Included for reference:

#### Reference: vitest.config.ts

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';
import path from 'path';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  test: {
    environment: 'jsdom',
    setupFiles: ['./vitest.setup.ts'],
    globals: true,
  },
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      '@': path.resolve(__dirname, './'),
    },
  },
});
```

#### Reference: vitest.setup.ts

```typescript
import '@testing-library/jest-dom';
import { expect, afterEach } from 'vitest';
import { cleanup } from '@testing-library/react';

afterEach(() => {
  cleanup();
});
```

#### Reference: playwright.config.ts

```typescript
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';

## 3. TDD Workflow Guide

### Red-Green-Refactor Cycle

For each feature:

1. **RED Phase**
   ```bash
   # Write failing tests first
   npm test -- --run
   # Expected: Tests fail (RED)
   ```

2. **GREEN Phase**
   ```bash
   # Implement minimal code to pass tests
   npm test -- --run
   # Expected: Tests pass (GREEN)
   ```

3. **REFACTOR Phase**
   ```bash
   # Improve code quality while keeping tests green
   npm test -- --run
   # Expected: Tests still pass (GREEN)
   ```

### Test Coverage Goals

- **Unit Tests**: > 80% coverage
- **Integration Tests**: All critical paths
- **E2E Tests**: All user journeys

Run coverage:
```bash
npm test -- --coverage
```
